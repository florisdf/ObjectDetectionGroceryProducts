# Object Detection Datasets in the Grocery Product Domain
This is a collection of datasets which are useful for object detection in the domain of grocery product detection. The credits for the respective datasets belong to the authors, which are credited with each dataset individually. These datasets were accumulated by the [Auto-ID Labs](https://www.autoidlabs.ch/) at the [ETH ZÃ¼rich](www.ethz.ch) within an ongoing effort to accelerate computer vision research in the grocery domain. The datasets were accumulated by Klaus Fuchs & Tobias Grundmann.

A dataset of labeled products in Swiss supermarket shelves. This dataset is a task-adaption one-shot learning dataset. For every product there is one labeled studio quality image of the product (in vitro) in the training dataset and the validation dataset consists of labeled frames in 29 videos with labeled bounding boxes in shelves in a shop realistic environment (in situ). low-quality images.

Version of GroZi120 with more products and higher quality images. A dataset of labeled products in Swiss supermarket shelves. This dataset is a task-adaption one-shot learning dataset. For every product there is one labeled studio quality image of the product (in vitro) in the training dataset and the validation dataset consists of images taken from a camcorder video with labeled bounding boxes on in shelves in a shop realistic environment (in situ).
